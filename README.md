## This Project Is Archived

It was cool at the time to be able to essentially send and receive webmentions, but as I've started working more and more at my primary job post-pandemic, I've been coding less and less on this. As Beaker Browser is archived as of 27 December 2022, consequently I'm archiving Beakermentions, Beakermentions Endpoint, and Beakermentions Validator.
